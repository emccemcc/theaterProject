Hello team!!!

This is the start of something beautiful.

This is the start of a story about Grant Chirpus.

Grant had come to Denver, seeking a fortune as a Mcdonald's franchise owner.

It was a complicated affiar because he was technically serving up his species, which is a big no-no.

But yet he persisted in moral ambugity to create a great franchise.

He was then sentenced to jail because that is a pretty bad thing to do.
