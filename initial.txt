Hello team!!!

This is the start of something beautiful.

This is the start of a story about Adam, Eric and Priyanka.

Eric had come to Denver, seeking a fortune as a McDonald's franchise owner.

It was a complicated affair because he was technically serving up his species, which is a big no-no.

But yet he persisted in moral ambiguity to create a great franchise.

He was then sentenced to jail because that is a pretty bad thing to do.
